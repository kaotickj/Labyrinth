My journey lasts for six days more,
Until my ship puts into shore.
I step upon a barren land,
Of withered trees and blackened sand.
In this land of which bards once sang,
Lives the Dwarf Lord Tor Endrafang.
I first must find this Dwarven Lord,
And win from him his magick sword.

Of the sword, Dwarven Warriors sing,
It's crosspiece forms a dragon's wings.
In dragon's fire the sword was made,
Runes of Power adorn the blade.
The pomel is a dragon's head,
With eyes that shine with rubies red.
Upon the hilt was placed it's name,
It once was known as Evil's Bane.
